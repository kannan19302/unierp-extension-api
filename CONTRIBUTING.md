# Contributing to unierp-extension-api

This repository is **L2 — Runtime** in the UniERP layered architecture.
It may depend on **L0, L1**, and nothing else.

## The rule that matters most here

**3 years' support, 12 months' deprecation notice.** Its own repository because that promise outlives any platform release. Scopes are the intersection of what the manifest requests and what the installing admin actually holds — an extension can never exceed its installer.

## Before you push

```bash
npm install
node scripts/check-layer.mjs   # if present: asserts the layer rule
npx tsc --noEmit
```

A dependency on a higher or sideways layer will fail CI. That is deliberate: the
whole reason this is a polyrepo rather than a monorepo is that the boundary
becomes impossible to cross rather than merely discouraged.

## Standards

See [`unierp-platform/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../unierp-platform/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
the platform-wide non-negotiables — tenant isolation, route guards, money as
Decimal, and never suppressing a check to make it pass.
